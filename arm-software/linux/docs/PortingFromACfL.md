# ACfL to ATfL porting guide

This section describes the key differences between using the Arm Toolchain for
Linux (ATfL) and the Arm Compiler for Linux (ACfL). It also lists command-line
options and macros that you can use with ATfL as alternatives to those used in
ACfL.

Both toolchains provide frontends for compiling C, C++, and Fortran code. The
names of these frontends are consistent across both: `armclang` for C,
`armclang++` for C++, and `armflang` for Fortran.

ATfL supports quadruple precision real and complex types. ACfL does not.

## Reference version

|Compiler                      |Version|
|------------------------------|-------|
|Arm Compiler for Linux (ACfL) |24.10  |
|Arm Toolchain for Linux (ATfL)|24.0.0 |

## ArmPL integration

In ACfL, Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL) are bundled with the compiler. To
simplify usage, the `-armpl` flag is provided to automatically include the
necessary headers and libraries for BLAS, LAPACK, FFT, and other numerical
routines.

In contrast, ATfL does not include ArmPL directly, but it depends on the ArmPL
package, which is installed alongside the toolchain. To use ArmPL with ATfL, you
must manually specify the locations of the headers and libraries using
`pkg-config`. See the [Getting started](./GettingStarted.md) guide for detailed
instructions.

### Note

Vector math functions from libamath are accessible without manually specifying
the libraries.

## C/C++ frontend

The C/C++ frontend in ATfL is identical to the one used in ACfL. Both are built
on the Clang frontend from the upstream LLVM project.

## Fortran frontend

The Fortran frontend in ATfL is based on the new LLVM Flang project. This
frontend is a modern, from-scratch implementation.
In contrast, ACfL used the older Classic Flang frontend, available at
[https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang).
Because ATfL introduces a new Fortran frontend, this section describes the
differences in Fortran support between the two toolchains.

### Major difference

|                |Compatibility|
|----------------|-------------|
|Binary          |No           |
|Module file     |No           |
|Array descriptor|No           |

gfortran and gives their equivalent in the Arm Fortran compiler:
